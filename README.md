# PC-Builder
This was a final project made for the class python concepts and methodology II, taken in spring 2021. The assignnment was as follows:

The final project for the class is principally a gui driven webscrape. Here're the requirements:

Scrape a website (or websites) or use an API to obtain information from a remote service.
All of the user interaction must be in the gui.
Information scraped from the web must be processed or parsed.
There must be at least one of each:
class defined and utilized in the code
loop
a file read or write
The script must be split across several files.
Docstrings must be utilized.
Code must adhere to PEP 8.
Sample Project:
A gui that allows you to generate a quote for supplying a local school with a basic 3d printing setup. It has the following parts:

Allow the user to select a 3d printer from one of several models. (Dropdown list?) Scrape the current price from the supplier.
Allow the user to select a material for filament (you don't need to check that the printer can support it), scrape the prices for several colors and average them.
Allow the user to enter a number of rolls of filament.
Incorporate all of the scraped and entered information into a shopping cart class. Run a method of the shopping cart class to generate a quote. Sales tax? Shipping?
Display the quote on the Gui with a save button.
Quote must be dated.
User changes to the above should change the quote.
The save button should write the quote to a file, it can be a simple text document, but nice formatting is nice.
